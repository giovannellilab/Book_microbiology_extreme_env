# The Microbiology fo Extreme Environments

This open textbook has been designed to be a reference for those approaching for the first time the microbiolpogy of extreme environemnts. It is purposfully written to be a textbook for non-microbiology majors requiringan introductory bopok on the subject matter. An extensive reference list is included for neach chapter, allowing for further, more extensive and specialized reading, should the necessity ariser.

The bookn is divided in 4 sections: 

- Microbiology Basics: In the first section a number of key biological and microbiological concepts are presented and reviewed. This section is strongly suggested to those that lack formal trainning in microbiology, genetics and microbial ecology, and might serve as a refresher for everyone;

- Microbial Metabolism: This section dwelves deeper in the metabolism of microbes, focusing on the carbon and energy metabolism from a Eartyh System perspective. Diverse metabolisms and biogeochemical cycles are discussed in this section.

- Microbial Diversity: This section presents and discusses microbial diversity using an organism centric approach.

- Extreme Environments: This section presents and summarized the functioning of the main extreme ecosystems on our planet

- A planetary view: This section described the functioning of our planets as iot pertains to the contribution of extreme envoironments and extremophiles and the their contribution to our society and outlines future research directions
